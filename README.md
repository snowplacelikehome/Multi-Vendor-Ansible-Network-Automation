# Multi-Vendor-Network-Role-Automation
Based on the reference repo from <https://gitlab.com/stuh84/network-automation-ansible>, this serves as an example of network automation using Ansible for scenarios where a few defined roles(configurations like NTP, Syslog, AAA) for a broad range of device vendors/models is needed - as opposed to scenarios where configuring most everything about a particular vendor/model is needed.

Refer to the reference repo for using a similar Ansible folder structure to configure everything about a model/vendor

Refer to [Multi-Vendor Network Role Automation README](./Ansible-Networking-README.md) for details about using this repo
